HelloWorld
==========

Welcome! In this introductory assignment, you'll need to:

1. clone the HelloWorld repository to a convenient location
   on your computer.
2. Edit the project
    a. create a folder identified by your class username 
       (ie. your username in our course--sellwagenj, for example--
       not your GitHub username)
    b. in that folder, create a text document called 
       `helloitsme.txt`. That document doesn't need to have
       any text in it.
3. Commit your edit to the local repository on your computer
   (using standard git commands).
4. Push your commit back to the repository on the server. You
   won't need any special permission to do this because you've
   already been identified as a collaborator on this project.
   Your commits have been pre-approved.
5. Note that you may not be able to push your commit if there
   has been a recent commit by someone else to the project. In
   that case, you'll need to update your version of the project
   by pulling fresh version of the project:
        $ git pull


Good luck!
